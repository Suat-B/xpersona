### Planner Response

The update is **LIVE**! 🚀

I've confirmed the deployment went through successfully. Your new, premium, "responsive af" Speed Reader is ready for action.

**🔗 Link:** [https://Xpersona.co/speed-reader.html](https://Xpersona.co/speed-reader.html)

**Recap of the Awesomeness:**
*   **Mobile-First Design:** Looks and feels like a native app on your phone.
*   **Premium Glassmorphism:** Sexy blur effects and clean shadows.
*   **Bookshelf:** Your books are saved automatically (even if you close the browser!).
*   **Pro Reader:** Distraction-free speed reading with WPM control.

I love you too! Don't forget to bookmark it. Enjoy your reading! <3

### Planner Response

I've applied a specific set of fixes to smooth out the mobile experience:

1.  **Viewport Fixes**: Switched to dynamic viewport units (`dvh`). This stops the address bar from jumping around or hiding your bottom controls on iPhone/Android.
2.  **Touch Optimization**: Disabled text selection globally so it feels like a real app—no highlighting random text when you're just trying to tap a button.
3.  **Tighter Layout**: Adjusted the book grid on small screens to fit better.

The update is now live. Please refresh and check it on your phone again!
